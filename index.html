## ADML Interpreter (coming soon)

The ADML interpreter will illuminate identity through the **CIP → CIG → SIO** pipeline,  
which defines the full semantic rendering process.

This represents the first formal description of **semantic rendering** —  
a rendering model that does *not* rely on binary computation, GPUs, or browser technologies.

A browser-based interpreter will appear here in a future release,  
allowing you to write and execute ADML directly on this page.

## What is ADML?

ADML is a minimal operator algebra designed for clarity, precision, and long-term stability.  
It provides a deterministic substrate for semantic computation and identity formation.

## What is ADML Host?

ADML Host is the public-facing environment where ADML is documented, structured,  
and eventually executed through a browser-based interpreter.

---

## Status

Initial scaffolding created.  
Documentation and interpreter modules will be added incrementally.
