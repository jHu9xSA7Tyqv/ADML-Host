# ADML Host

**Author:** Irwin  
**Created:** February 23, 2026  
**Description:**  
ADML Host is the official environment for the ADML operator algebra.  
This repository provides the documentation, substrate architecture, and future browser-based interpreter for ADML.

---

## Project Description
ADML Host is the public-facing substrate for the ADML operator algebra.  
It defines the structure, documentation, and execution environment for ADML-based systems.

---

## Purpose
ADML Host serves as the public-facing substrate for:
- ADML language specification  
- ADML interpreter development  
- Semantic substrate architecture  
- Examples, demos, and reference implementations  

---

## Long-Term Vision
- Establish ADML as a minimal, lawful operator algebra  
- Provide a browser-based ADML interpreter  
- Document the semantic substrate architecture  
- Support MAGOS and micro-intelligence cell integration  
- Maintain a clean, future-proof public reference

---

## Repository Structure (planned)
- `/spec` — ADML language specification  
- `/interpreter` — Browser-based ADML interpreter  
- `/examples` — Sample ADML programs  
- `/docs` — Extended documentation  
- `/assets` — Diagrams, images, and static files  

---

## Status
Initial scaffolding created.  
Documentation and interpreter modules will be added incrementally.
