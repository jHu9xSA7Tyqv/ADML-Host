# ADML Host and Construct Integration Overview

## Purpose

This page explains how **ADML Host** and **Construct** work together as a single,
sovereign architecture spanning digital and physical substrates.

It is intended as the primary orientation document for reviewers and collaborators.

## High-level model

- **ADML Host**  
  Public, DOE-facing documentation and stable reference pages.

- **Construct**  
  Internal working environment for:
  - legacy modernization,
  - empirical iteration,
  - and substrate-governed workflows.

- **UMG (Unified Materials Governance)**  
  Connects physical materials and assemblies to the same deterministic discipline
  used in the digital substrate.

## Separation of concerns

### ADML Host

- Stable URLs and narratives
- Policy, rationale, and high-level diagrams
- DOE and institutional review surface
- Minimal churn; changes are deliberate and versioned

### Construct

- Active development and experimentation
- HTML/HTM modernization and path cleanup
- Spatial and substrate modeling
- Frequent redeploys and empirical adjustments

## Data and workflow flow

1. **Concept and iteration in Construct**
   - New structures, workflows, and layouts are developed.
   - Paths, assets, and behaviors are validated empirically.

2. **Governance via UMG**
   - Physical and digital decisions are reconciled.
   - Approved patterns and materials are recorded.

3. **Publication in ADML Host**
   - Only stable, reviewed narratives and diagrams are promoted.
   - DOE-facing pages reference UMG and Construct outputs without exposing internal churn.

## Sovereign architecture

The system is designed so that:

- You retain **direct substrate control** (digital and physical).
- No external platform dictates structure or identity.
- ADML Host remains the canonical public surface.
- Construct remains the internal engine of change.

## Orientation for reviewers

If you are reviewing this system:

- Start with this **Integration Overview**.
- Use **UMG** to understand material and assembly governance.
- Use ADML Host pages for stable policy and architecture views.
- Treat Construct as the internal workshop that feeds, but does not destabilize, the public surface.
