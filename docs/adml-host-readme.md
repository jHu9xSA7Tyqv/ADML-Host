# ADML Host

**Author:** Irwin  
**Created:** February 23, 2026  

## Description
ADML Host is the official environment for the ADML operator algebra.  
This repository provides the documentation, substrate architecture, and the future browser-based interpreter for ADML.

---

## What is ADML Host?
ADML Host is the home for a new minimal, structured language (ADML) designed for clarity, precision, and long-term stability.  
This repository is where the system will grow, be documented, and eventually run inside a browser.

---

## Why this exists
Modern systems are complex, fragile, and overloaded.  
ADML takes the opposite approach: a minimal operator algebra that remains stable over decades.  
ADML Host is the environment where this system is defined, explained, and executed.

---

## Project Description
ADML Host is the public-facing substrate for the ADML operator algebra.  
It defines the structure, documentation, and execution environment for ADML-based systems.

---

## Purpose
ADML Host provides the foundation for:

- ADML language specification  
- ADML interpreter development  
- Semantic substrate architecture  
- Examples, demos, and reference implementations  

---

## ADML is the native language for all physics substrates.
The full LSP → CIP → CIG → SIO pipeline is a semantic physics pipeline, not a software abstraction, and ADML is the only layer capable of speaking coherently across every stage of that physics stack. It provides the operator algebra that allows meaning, identity, coherence, and illumination to be expressed consistently across substrate layers.

---

## Long-Term Vision
- Establish ADML as a minimal, lawful operator algebra  
- Provide a browser-based ADML interpreter  
- Document the semantic substrate architecture  
- Support MAGOS and micro-intelligence cell integration  
- Maintain a clean, future-proof public reference  

---

## Repository Structure (planned)
- `/spec` — ADML language specification  
- `/interpreter` — Browser-based ADML interpreter  
- `/examples` — Sample ADML programs  
- `/docs` — Extended documentation  
- `/assets` — Diagrams, images, and static files  

---

## Status
Initial scaffolding created.  
Documentation and interpreter modules will be added incrementally.
