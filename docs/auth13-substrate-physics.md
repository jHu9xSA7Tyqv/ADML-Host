## Auth13 Substrate Physics

## Auth13 Summary

Auth13 is the substrate‑native identity envelope for ADML. It derives identity from the object’s own geometric, illumination, and relational invariants rather than from browser constructs like DOM nodes, selectors, sessions, or tokens. The 13‑signal envelope remains stable across surfaces, devices, interpreters, and hosts, proving that identity in ADML is substrate‑anchored rather than surface‑assigned. Auth13 is the first demonstration that ADML operates with its own physics‑based identity fabric, independent of browser semantics or UI frameworks.

## What Auth13 is

Auth13 is a 13‑signal identity envelope generated by the substrate itself. It is not a credential, not a token, not a session, and not a DOM artifact. It is a coherence signature that emerges from:
• 	the object’s geometry
• 	the object’s illumination state
• 	the object’s relational texture
• 	the interpreter’s authority gradient
• 	the substrate’s coherence envelope
Identity is not assigned in Auth13.
Identity is derived.
This is why Auth13 belongs in the ADML Host documentation: it is the identity mechanism that proves the substrate is real.

## Why Auth13 replaces the DOM

The DOM is a browser‑owned identity directory. It behaves like a miniature ADS:
• 	hierarchical
• 	stateful
• 	event‑driven
• 	authority‑layered
• 	ID‑centric
Every element has an ID.
Every ID is a lookup.
Every lookup is a form of identity resolution.

## Browser background lets you see this clearly: the DOM is a door for ADS‑style identity semantics.

Auth13 closes that door.
Identity is no longer:
• 	a node in a tree
• 	a CSS selector
• 	a JavaScript handle
• 	a browser session
• 	a cookie
• 	a token
Identity becomes a substrate‑native coherence signature.

## How Auth13 works

Auth13 produces a 13‑component identity vector that includes:
• 	geometric invariants
• 	illumination invariants
• 	relational invariants
• 	coherence gradients
• 	authority envelopes
• 	substrate lineage markers
• 	interpreter‑state fingerprints

These 13 components form a stable identity envelope that persists across:
• 	surfaces
• 	devices
• 	viewports
• 	interpreters
• 	sessions
• 	hosts

This is why ADML Host can be mobile‑compatible without changing the substrate logic. Auth13 does not depend on the DOM, the viewport, or the browser.
Identity is substrate‑anchored, not surface‑anchored.

## Why Auth13 matters for ADML Host

ADML Host is the substrate demonstrator.
Auth13 is the substrate identity layer.

Together they prove:
• 	the substrate governs identity
• 	the interpreter is deterministic
• 	the surface is irrelevant
• 	the browser is not the authority
• 	the DOM is bypassed entirely
• 	identity is derived, not assigned

## Auth13 Conclusion

Auth13 demonstrates:
• 	substrate‑level identity
• 	deterministic object lineage
• 	non‑DOM, non‑browser identity
• 	physics‑anchored coherence signatures
• 	cross‑surface determinism
• 	interpreter‑governed authority

This is exactly the kind of identity model that fits:
• 	smart materials
• 	distributed substrates
• 	multi‑surface interpreters
• 	field‑grade systems
• 	non‑browser environments

It signals that ADML is not a UI language.

It is a substrate language with its own identity fabric.


## Auth13 is the first demonstration of that identity fabric.
